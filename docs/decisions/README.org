#+TITLE: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#+DATE: 2025-10-04
#+DESCRIPTION: Index of all architecture decisions for the Timeless calendar

* What Are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant technical and design decisions made during development. Each ADR captures:
- The context and problem
- The decision made
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences (positive and negative)

* Why Use ADRs?

Decision rationale gets lost over time. ADRs preserve the "why" behind architectural choices, helping future developers (including AI assistants) understand trade-offs without re-litigating settled decisions.

* ADR Index

** Active ADRs

Currently, no formal ADRs have been created. As significant decisions are made, they will be documented here.

** Template

Use this template for new ADRs:

#+begin_src org
#+TITLE: ADR-NNNN: [Short Title]
#+DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
#+STATUS: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

* Context
What is the issue we're facing? What forces are at play?

* Decision
What decision did we make?

* Alternatives Considered
1. Option A - why rejected
2. Option B - why rejected

* Consequences
** Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

** Negative
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

* References
- [[file:../design-architecture.org::*Related Section][Related architecture]]
- [[file:../codebase-wisdom.org::*Related Bug][Related debugging insight]]
#+end_src

* Naming Convention

ADRs should be named: `adr-NNNN-short-descriptive-title.org`

Examples:
- adr-0001-no-animations-principle.org
- adr-0002-local-storage-only.org
- adr-0003-react-without-state-library.org

* When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Making architectural decisions that affect multiple components
- Choosing between competing design approaches
- Establishing constraints or principles (like "no animations")
- Making trade-offs that future developers should understand

* Cross-Referencing

ADRs should be referenced from:
- [[file:../design-architecture.org][design-architecture.org]] - Link to relevant ADRs in technical sections
- [[file:../critical-next-steps.org][critical-next-steps.org]] - When decisions affect roadmap
- [[file:../codebase-wisdom.org][codebase-wisdom.org]] - When bugs reveal decision trade-offs
