#+title: Experimental Mode Visual Variants Plan
#+author: Timeless Design Team
#+options: toc:nil

* Roadmap
1. Document visual specs for the themed variants (captured below).
2. Prototype the calendar styles for each variant behind experimental mode toggles.
3. Polish motion, micro-interactions, and responsive behaviour per theme.
4. Run accessibility and usability passes (contrast, focus states, keyboard cues).

* Design Philosophy (Based on Canonical If-Then Page Analysis)
All variants should follow "Premium Minimalism" / "Soft Modernism" principles:
- Multi-layer soft shadows with very low opacity (5-15%)
- Generous border radius (rounded-2xl to rounded-3xl)
- Frosted glass aesthetic with backdrop-blur
- Muted accent colors at 5-15% opacity maximum
- Zinc/slate/stone grays, never pure grays
- Generous white space (minimum p-6 padding)
- Subtle hover states (shadow deepening, no aggressive transforms)
- Wide letter-spacing on small uppercase labels
- Clean, non-overlapping borders at 60-70% opacity
- Light backgrounds only (no dark themes)

* Currently Active Variants
** DONE Calm Pastels (Refined 2025-10-02)
- Palette :: Zinc-50/100/200 base, neutral pastels at very low opacity
- Typography :: Light-weight sans-serif, ample line spacing
- Treatments ::
  - Softened palette to remove cloying colors
  - Gentle drop shadows and rounded-2xl corners
  - Subtle animations (slow pulse around current day)
  - Smooth scale transitions on hover
  - Minimal icon set with softened strokes
- Status :: Under review after palette refinement

** DONE Zen Monoline (Fixed 2025-10-02)
- Palette :: Monochrome base with tempered accent (charcoal, off-white, muted gold)
- Typography :: Condensed uppercase labels, classic sans-serif body
- Treatments ::
  - Line-art approach with thin strokes and dotted separators
  - Soft shading to highlight the active week
  - Low-saturation icons, minimal color density
  - Focus states via weight and line thickness changes
  - Fixed: No transform on hover to prevent border overlap
- Status :: Technical issue resolved, borders stay crisp

** DONE Nordic Frost
- Palette :: Ice blue (#E0F2FE), slate (#475569), crystalline white, silver accents
- Typography :: Clean geometric sans with wide letterspacing
- Treatments ::
  - Frosted glass cards with crystalline texture
  - Snowflake or ice crystal micro-animations
  - Cool blue glow on focus states
  - Smooth glide transitions mimicking ice sliding
  - Seasonal aurora effect in header during winter months
- Status :: Approved - "very nice"

* Proposed New Variants (Based on Canonical Preferences)
** Tier 1: High Confidence
*** Soft Teal Glass
- Palette :: Zinc-50/100/200 base, muted teal (#0f766e) at 8-15% opacity
- Typography :: Wide tracking on labels (0.25em), slate-700 body text (#334155)
- Treatments ::
  - rounded-3xl (24px) for all cards
  - Multi-layer soft shadows: 0_20px_48px_rgba(15,118,110,0.08)
  - backdrop-blur with bg-white/95
  - Borders at border-zinc-200/70
  - Hover: Shadow deepening only, no transform
  - Gradient dividers: from-transparent via-teal-500/20 to-transparent
- Rationale :: Direct translation of canonical if-then aesthetic to calendar

*** Lavender Mist
- Palette :: Zinc-50/100/200 base, soft lavender (#a78bfa) at 6-10% opacity
- Typography :: Same as Soft Teal Glass
- Treatments ::
  - Same structure as Soft Teal Glass
  - Replace teal accent with whisper of lavender
  - Remove all cloying pastels from Calm Pastels
  - Keep 95% neutral, lavender only in subtle accents
- Rationale :: Calm Pastels refined to canonical standards

*** Charcoal Soft
- Palette :: Neutral-50/100/200 base, charcoal (#404040) at 5-8% opacity
- Typography :: Same as Soft Teal Glass
- Treatments ::
  - Monochromatic sophistication
  - Same canonical structure as Soft Teal Glass
  - No color accent, just perfect grays and shadows
  - Ultra-refined, professional, timeless
- Rationale :: Zen Monoline elevated with canonical refinement

** Tier 2: Exploration
*** Warm Amber Glow
- Palette :: Stone-50/100/200 base, warm amber (#d97706) at 8-12% opacity
- Typography :: Same as canonical baseline
- Treatments ::
  - Same generous radius and soft shadows as Soft Teal
  - Subtle amber tint in gradients (from-stone-50 via-amber-50/20)
  - Warmer alternative to teal
- Rationale :: Warm variant while maintaining refined approach

*** Sky Blue Serenity
- Palette :: Slate-50/100/200 base, soft sky blue (#0ea5e9) at 8-12% opacity
- Typography :: Same as canonical baseline
- Treatments ::
  - Same structure as Soft Teal Glass
  - Cooler than teal, warmer than Nordic Frost
  - Gentle sky-blue gradient accents
- Rationale :: Temperature variation within canonical comfort zone

*** Sage Whisper
- Palette :: Zinc-50/100/200 base, muted sage (#6b8e6f) at 8-12% opacity
- Typography :: Same as canonical baseline
- Treatments ::
  - Remove grating mint from Botanical Minimal
  - Use proper sage at low opacity
  - Same canonical soft shadows and spacing
  - Natural but not aggressive
- Rationale :: Botanical Minimal fixed with refinement and subtlety

* Removed Variants (Failed User Testing 2025-10-02)
These variants violated the "Premium Minimalism" principles and have been removed:

** Dark Theme Variants (Rejected - Dark backgrounds)
- Modern UI :: Purple/indigo gradients too harsh
- Aurora Glass :: Dark theme + overlapping borders
- Liquid Motion :: Dark theme
- Holographic Shimmer :: Dark theme

** Too Bland (Rejected - Insufficient contrast/interest)
- Paper Atlas :: Too blah, too bland
- Paper Craft :: Too blah, too bland

** Too Intense (Rejected - Garish or overwhelming)
- Solar Dawn :: Too bright and in-your-face
- Vaporwave Sunset :: Garish aesthetic
- Memphis Postmodern :: Garish, terrible
- Brutalist Grid :: Hate this style entirely

** Color Issues (Rejected - Grating or cloying colors)
- Botanical Minimal :: Mint green color is grating

** Contrast Issues (Rejected - Poor visibility)
- Neomorphic Zen :: Lacks contrast

** Animation Issues (Rejected - Too aggressive)
- Micro Interactions Lab :: Too in-your-face, not subtle

* Implementation Notes
- Build each theme as a variant entry for =useExperimentalMode=, toggled via =data-experimental-variant= attributes.
- Use CSS custom properties to swap palettes, blur intensity, and corner radii per theme.
- Layer micro-interactions (hover states, spring animations, focus cues) consistent with each style.
- Validate responsive layouts alongside keyboard navigation and screen-reader semantics.

* Theme Variants (Implemented 2025-10-02)
** Calm Pastels
- Goal :: Mindful palette with gentle motion and softened gradients
- Highlights :: Pulsing today state, desaturated blues, reduced contrast for longer sessions
- Questions :: Does the pastel palette maintain legibility over multi-hour reviews?

** Zen Monoline
- Goal :: Monochrome precision with typographic hierarchy
- Highlights :: Line-art framing, uppercase labels, strict border alignment
- Questions :: Do the minimal cues work with the new default timeline spine?

** Nordic Frost
- Goal :: Frosted glass aesthetic with crystalline micro-accents
- Highlights :: Aurora shimmer in headers, snowflake hover detail, icy blue buttons
- Questions :: Do the frosted effects remain readable on lower-contrast displays?

** Soft Studio
- Goal :: Soft modernism gradient inspired by canonical If-Then view
- Highlights :: Glassmorphism cards, neutral gradients, gentle glow on interactions
- Questions :: Does the added sheen elevate without distracting from content?
-- **All variants keep functionality identicalâ€”only visual theme changes.**
-- Use Option+X cycling to compare against baseline before iterating further.

* Next Steps
1. Implement Tier 1 variants (Soft Teal Glass, Lavender Mist, Charcoal Soft)
2. User testing of Tier 1 variants
3. If successful, proceed with Tier 2 variants (Warm Amber, Sky Blue, Sage)
4. Archive or delete removed variant CSS to reduce bundle size
