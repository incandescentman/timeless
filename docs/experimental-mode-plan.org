#+title: Experimental Mode Visual Variants Plan
#+author: Timeless Design Team
#+options: toc:nil

* Roadmap
1. Document visual specs for the themed variants (captured below).
2. Prototype the calendar styles for each variant behind experimental mode toggles.
3. Polish motion, micro-interactions, and responsive behaviour per theme.
4. Run accessibility and usability passes (contrast, focus states, keyboard cues).

* Implement these ones now:

- Palette :: Warm paper tones, ink blues (#1E40AF), red accents (#DC2626)
- Typography :: Handwritten-style accents with clean sans-serif body
- Treatments ::

- Typography :: Rounded sans-serif with playful weight variations
- Treatments ::
  - Morphing liquid blob shapes on interaction
  - Wave animations and spring physics transitions
  - Ripple effects on clicks and flowing gradient transitions
  - Fluid highlight sweep across the active row

** DONE Botanical Minimal
- Palette :: Sage green (#6B8E6F), terracotta (#C2634D), cream (#FAF5F0)
- Typography :: Serif display headings with clean sans body
- Treatments ::
  - Subtle leaf pattern overlays and natural texture
  - Organic, asymmetric shapes framing the calendar
  - Hand-drawn botanical accents per season
  - Seasonal color transitions for month headers

* Do not implement these yet
** Brutalist Grid
- Palette :: High-contrast black/white with single electric accent (#00FF00 or #FF0066)
- Typography :: Extended mono or grotesque sans; oversized labels with tight tracking
- Treatments ::
  - Hard-edged grid lines and boxy calendar cells
  - Stark borders, zero rounded corners
  - Aggressive typographic hierarchy (massive day numbers)
  - Abrupt state changes (no transitions), bold focus rectangles
  - Optional scanline or CRT distortion overlay

** Holographic Shimmer
- Palette :: Iridescent gradients (chrome, rainbow shift), dark base (#0A0A0F)
- Typography :: Futuristic sans with chromatic aberration on headings
- Treatments ::
  - Animated holographic foil effect on calendar surface
  - Color-shifting borders based on viewing angle (simulated via mouse position)
  - Prism light leak animations
  - Floating depth layers with parallax
  - Metallic sheen on interactive elements

** Vaporwave Sunset
- Palette :: Magenta (#FF0080), cyan (#00FFFF), deep purple (#4A0080), sunset gradient
- Typography :: Retro-futuristic with Japanese glyphs or Greek statue imagery
- Treatments ::
  - Palm tree or geometric wireframe silhouettes in background
  - VHS tracking distortion and chromatic aberration
  - Grid floor perspective effect beneath calendar
  - Neon outline glow on month headers
  - Synthwave sun gradient animation

** Micro Interactions Lab
- Palette :: Neutral base with dynamic accent color per interaction type
- Typography :: Clean system fonts optimized for motion clarity
- Treatments ::
  - Spring physics on every hover, click, focus
  - Magnetic snap-to-grid for selections
  - Haptic-style vibration animations
  - Dynamic color sampling from time of day or system wallpaper
  - Staggered cascade animations for grid population
  - Gesture-driven swipe transitions with inertia

** Nordic Frost
- Palette :: Ice blue (#E0F2FE), slate (#475569), crystalline white, silver accents
- Typography :: Clean geometric sans with wide letterspacing
- Treatments ::
  - Frosted glass cards with crystalline texture
  - Snowflake or ice crystal micro-animations
  - Cool blue glow on focus states
  - Smooth glide transitions mimicking ice sliding
  - Seasonal aurora effect in header during winter months

** Memphis Postmodern
- Palette :: Primary colors (red, yellow, blue) + black/white, geometric patterns
- Typography :: Bold sans-serif mixed with quirky display fonts
- Treatments ::
  - Abstract geometric shapes (squiggles, grids, dots) as decorative elements
  - Asymmetric layouts with playful misalignment
  - High-contrast color blocking per calendar row
  - Pop-art style hover states (flat color swaps)
  - Retro halftone dot patterns as backgrounds

* Implementation Notes
- Build each theme as a variant entry for =useExperimentalMode=, toggled via =data-experimental-variant= attributes.
- Use CSS custom properties to swap palettes, blur intensity, and corner radii per theme.
- Layer micro-interactions (hover states, spring animations, focus cues) consistent with each style.
- Validate responsive layouts alongside keyboard navigation and screen-reader semantics.
