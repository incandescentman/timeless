#+title: Experimental Mode Visual Variants Plan
#+author: Timeless Design Team
#+options: toc:nil

* Roadmap
1. Document visual specs for the themed variants (captured below).
2. Prototype the calendar styles for each variant behind experimental mode toggles.
3. Polish motion, micro-interactions, and responsive behaviour per theme.
4. Run accessibility and usability passes (contrast, focus states, keyboard cues).

* Variant Specs
** Aurora Glass
- Palette :: Deep indigo base, aurora gradients (teal, violet, magenta), white accents
- Typography :: Sans-serif with subtle weight shifts; gradient-filled headers
- Treatments ::
  - Multi-layered glassmorphic cards with varying blur intensities
  - Smooth aurora gradient animation in the background
  - Light refraction hover states and animated focus rings
  - Floating UI elements with soft shadows; glowing pill buttons
  - Optional parallax particle layer for depth

** Paper Atlas
- Palette :: Cream paper background, ink blues, muted accents
- Typography :: Serif headings paired with clean sans-serif body text
- Treatments ::
  - Textured backgrounds and layered “paper” cards
  - Soft shadows and ink-like hover states
  - Sticky-note widgets and hand-drawn iconography
  - Slightly offset elements to mimic editorial layouts

** Solar Dawn
- Palette :: Sunrise gradients (peach → amber), warm neutrals, bold accent yellow
- Typography :: Oversized hero headings, rounded sans-serif body
- Treatments ::
  - Color-blocked month headers and floating chips
  - Animated day transitions with dawn-inspired fade/slide
  - Rounded geometry and generous corner radii
  - Ambient glow around the “today” indicator

** Calm Pastels
- Palette :: Muted pastels (lavender, mint, blush) with soft neutrals
- Typography :: Light-weight sans-serif, ample line spacing
- Treatments ::
  - Gentle drop shadows and rounded corners
  - Meditative animations (e.g., slow pulsing around the current day)
  - Smooth scale transitions on hover
  - Minimal icon set with softened strokes

** Zen Monoline
- Palette :: Monochrome base with tempered accent (charcoal, off-white, muted gold)
- Typography :: Condensed uppercase labels, classic sans-serif body
- Treatments ::
  - Line-art approach with thin strokes and dotted separators
  - Soft shading to highlight the active week
  - Low-saturation icons, minimal color density
  - Focus states expressed via weight and line thickness changes

** Neomorphic Zen
- Palette :: Neutral grays (~#E5E7EB), soft whites, accent teal (#14B8A6)
- Typography :: Minimalist sans-serif with variable font weights
- Treatments ::
  - Neumorphic embossed/debossed calendar cells
  - Inner/outer shadows for soft depth
  - Organic rounded corners and ambient light simulation
  - Subtle tactile feedback animations

** Paper Craft
- Palette :: Warm paper tones, ink blues (#1E40AF), red accents (#DC2626)
- Typography :: Handwritten-style accents with clean sans-serif body
- Treatments ::
  - Layered paper cards with realistic textures
  - Page-flip animations between months
  - Torn edge effects and paper grain overlays
  - Ink-style hover/active states

** Liquid Motion
- Palette :: Ocean blues (#0891B2), coral (#FB7185), sandy beige (#FEF3C7)
- Typography :: Rounded sans-serif with playful weight variations
- Treatments ::
  - Morphing liquid blob shapes on interaction
  - Wave animations and spring physics transitions
  - Ripple effects on clicks and flowing gradient transitions
  - Fluid highlight sweep across the active row

** Botanical Minimal
- Palette :: Sage green (#6B8E6F), terracotta (#C2634D), cream (#FAF5F0)
- Typography :: Serif display headings with clean sans body
- Treatments ::
  - Subtle leaf pattern overlays and natural texture
  - Organic, asymmetric shapes framing the calendar
  - Hand-drawn botanical accents per season
  - Seasonal color transitions for month headers

* Implementation Notes
- Build each theme as a variant entry for =useExperimentalMode=, toggled via =data-experimental-variant= attributes.
- Use CSS custom properties to swap palettes, blur intensity, and corner radii per theme.
- Layer micro-interactions (hover states, spring animations, focus cues) consistent with each style.
- Validate responsive layouts alongside keyboard navigation and screen-reader semantics.
