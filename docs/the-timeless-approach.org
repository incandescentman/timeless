* Background Story and Motivation

Most digital calendars mimic their paper ancestors: a single month at a time, day planners, week views. They trap us in short-term thinking, optimizing for the urgent rather than the important.

Timeless was created for people who think in years, not days. It's a calendar for those who want to see the shape of their year at a glance, to plan with perspective, and to escape the tyranny of the immediate.

The name "Timeless" reflects two core beliefs:
1. **Design that endures**: No trendy animations, no flashy transitions, just clean typography and intentional whitespace
2. **Temporal perspective**: Viewing time at the scale of years creates clarity and reduces noise

* Core Principles

** Think in Years, Not Days

The fundamental interface is a full year view showing all 12 months simultaneously. This forces a shift in perspective from "what's happening this week?" to "what matters this year?"

When you can see January through December at once, patterns emerge. Clusters of activity, gaps for rest, the rhythm of seasons become visible.

** Minimal by Design

Every element serves a purpose. Every color choice is intentional. Nothing moves unless the user moves it.

Specific constraints:
- Zero animations or CSS transitions
- Limited color palette: neutral grays + red accent (today only)
- Clean sans-serif typography
- Generous whitespace
- No decorative elements

This isn't minimalism for aesthetics—it's minimalism for focus.

** Timeless Aesthetic

The application should look as relevant in 2035 as it does today. No design trends, no fashionable gradients, no micro-interactions.

Like a well-designed book or a classic watch, the interface fades into the background, letting content take center stage.

** Data Ownership

Events are stored locally. No cloud sync (yet), no accounts, no vendor lock-in. Your calendar data belongs to you.

The Event data structure is designed for backward compatibility—new features can be added without breaking existing events.

* Purpose Statement

**Timeless exists to help people think and plan at the scale of years.**

It's not for micromanaging your Tuesday. It's for seeing the arc of your projects, the rhythm of your seasons, and the shape of your ambitions.

* Key Terminology

See [[file:concept-map.org][concept-map.org]] for detailed definitions.

Core concepts:
- **Year View**: The primary interface showing all 12 months
- **Today Cell**: Current date highlighted in red
- **Event**: User-created calendar entry
- **Minimal Design**: Our aesthetic and technical constraint
- **No Animations**: A strict design rule
- **Invariants**: Non-negotiable constraints (backward compatibility, today highlighting, etc.)

* Design Philosophy in Practice

** What We Include
- Full year visibility
- Simple event creation
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Instant responsiveness (no loading states for local operations)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

** What We Exclude
- Weekly or daily views (use your phone's calendar for that)
- Complex recurring events (keep it simple)
- Integrations with other calendars (not yet)
- Notifications and reminders (too urgent)
- Collaborative features (solo tool)
- Themes and customization (one design, done well)

** Why These Exclusions Matter

Every feature request should be filtered through the question: "Does this support year-scale thinking?"

If the answer is no—if it's about optimizing the next hour or the next day—it doesn't belong in Timeless.

* Evolution Principles

Timeless will evolve, but slowly and deliberately. Changes should:

1. **Preserve the core**: Year view, minimal design, no animations
2. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Never break existing events
3. **Add capability, not complexity**: New features should feel inevitable, not bolted-on
4. **Respect the aesthetic**: New UI elements must match the timeless design language
