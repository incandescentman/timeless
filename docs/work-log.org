** Session: Mobile swipe gestures
Time: Afternoon
Task: Restore swipe-to-delete and add swipe-to-edit affordances
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
- Mobile event rows ignored horizontal swipes, so deleting required opening the editor, and month-level swipe handlers sometimes hijacked the gesture.

Root Cause:
- Legacy `react-swipeable` wiring on `DayEventRow` never attached to the DOM node once the virtualization refactor landed, so events passed through to the calendar container.
- Calendar-level swipe listeners lacked guards, so horizontal drags on event text fired month navigation instead of note actions.

Solution:
- Replaced the unused hook with a bespoke touch tracker that distinguishes horizontal intent, prevents vertical scroll interference, and maps right swipe to delete and left swipe to inline edit.
- Suppressed click bubbling after swipes so accidental taps don’t re-open editors and added calendar-level guards to ignore swipes that originate inside event rows or the mobile composer.
- Preserved existing keyboard editing behavior and desktop interactions while keeping the action thresholds high enough to avoid accidental triggers.

Files Changed:
- src/components/DayCell.jsx — added touch state machine to handle left/right swipes, trigger delete/edit, and suppress accidental clicks.
- src/components/Calendar.jsx — guarded month navigation swipe handlers to skip gestures originating from event rows or composer surfaces.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- Explore lightweight visual affordances (e.g., hint overlay or haptic note) so users discover the new swipe edit gesture.

** Session: Simplify Mobile Composer
Time: Afternoon
Task: Align mobile note entry with canonical minimalist capture
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
- Mobile overlay presented redundant controls (`Cancel`, `Dismiss`, `Add`) that cluttered the minimalist flow and conflicted with the canonical tap-out behavior.

Root Cause:
- Legacy modal implementation relied on explicit action buttons instead of automatically committing on blur/outside interactions like the canonical/minimalist experience.

Solution:
- Refactored `MobileEventComposer` to request focus on the first frame so Mobile Safari spawns the keyboard immediately, and funnel close events through a `commitAndClose` helper that saves non-empty drafts and otherwise closes silently.
- Removed the footer button row; outside taps, Escape key, and blur now either save or dismiss based on content without double-submitting via the new `ignoreBlurRef` guard.
- Restyled the modal to float mid-screen with centered metadata plus the Minimalist-style checkmark hint so it mirrors the canonical capture experience while staying within Timeless color tokens.

Files Changed:
- src/components/MobileEventComposer.jsx — simplified control flow, added commit-on-blur behavior, and enriched input attributes for mobile keyboards.
- src/styles/mobile-composer.css — updated sheet layout, typography, and dark mode colors to match the new single-field design.
- docs/design-architecture.org — documented the auto-save overlay behavior so future edits preserve the minimalist pattern.

Tests:
- npm run build

* 2025-10-11 Saturday

** Session: Stabilize Mobile Composer Focus Flow
Time: Morning
Task: Fix iOS composer regressions (no open, caret drift, infinite reopen loop)
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
- Mobile composer stopped opening on taps and the keyboard cursor floated below the input. Tapping outside to save dropped straight back into the composer, trapping users.

Root Cause:
- Fixed-body scroll lock + backdrop blur broke WebKit’s caret positioning. Closing the composer left the day cell immediately re-firable, so the overlay reopened on the same tap.

Solution:
- Removed the fixed-body lock and blur; instead used an opaque scrim, intercepted touchmove on the overlay, and added coarse-pointer focus retries.
- Added a short-lived suppression window when closing so the originating day cell can’t instantly re-open the composer; guarded click handler with that flag.
- Updated documentation to capture the new behavior and viewport adjustments.

Files Changed:
- src/components/MobileEventComposer.jsx — reworked focus retry entry point, touch suppression, and blur behavior.
- src/components/DayCell.jsx — added composer-close suppression to avoid immediate reopen.
- src/styles/mobile-composer.css — removed backdrop blur and ensured the overlay blocks touch scrolling.
- docs/drafts/mobile-event-composer-bug-analysis.org — logged implementation snapshot for future debugging.
- index.html — relaxed viewport meta tag for natural keyboard zoom.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- QA on physical iOS/Android devices to confirm keyboard alignment and repeated capture flows.

Next Step:
- QA on physical iOS Safari to confirm outside-tap persistence and keyboard “Done” flow behave identically.

** Session: Restore Centered Initial Viewport
Time: Afternoon
Task: Stop launch crawl from January 2020 and keep Today-centered viewport
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
App launch snapped to October 2025 but `scroll-behavior: smooth` forced a long animated crawl from January 2020, and hydration re-measurements occasionally nudged Today back to the top edge.

Root Cause:
- Global CSS applied `scroll-behavior: smooth` to `<html, body>`, overriding the virtualizer's `behavior: 'auto'` requests.
- The virtualized month list recalculated heights during initial measurement and reissued the auto scroll without preserving the centered offset.

Solution:
- Removed the global smooth-scroll rule so only explicit smooth requests animate.
- Updated `VirtualizedMonthList` to respect caller-provided smooth behavior, while retry attempts fall back to instant scrolls for stability.
- Added a guard that tracks the initial target (month index + date) so post-measurement updates don't re-snap the viewport.
- Tightened the mobile layout by zeroing week-to-week gaps so Sunday and Monday flow seamlessly in the stacked view.
- Hardened keyboard shortcuts to ignore system modifiers so OS commands (e.g., Command+C) pass through.

Files Changed:
- src/styles/mobile.css — removed root-level `scroll-behavior: smooth` and zeroed mobile week-row gaps so Sunday/Monday align.
- src/components/VirtualizedMonthList.jsx — preserved smooth behavior for user actions, tracked initial snap target, and prevented post-measurement recentering.
- src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.js — gated single-key shortcuts behind modifier checks so native combos keep working.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- Monitor for other global CSS that overrides virtualizer behavior (notably `overscroll-behavior` or scroll snapping).

** Session: Distinguish Overflow Days Without Removing Weeks
Time: Evening
Task: Make month-boundary weeks readable without duplicating content
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
Users perceived the final week of a month as duplicated once the next month rendered, because the Oct 27–Nov 2 row appeared identically above and below the November header.

Root Cause:
Both months legitimately include that week (monthly grids show leading/trailing days), but we treated every day identically. Without visual differentiation, the repeated row looked like a rendering bug.

Solution:
- Passed an `isCurrentMonth` flag from `Calendar.jsx` into `DayCell` so each day knows whether it belongs to the active month.
- Added an `outside-month` class to soften typography and backgrounds for spillover days while keeping them interactive.
- Updated day-cell styling for light/dark modes so overflow days are muted, not removed, preserving calendar integrity but eliminating the perception of duplication.
- On mobile, render the month header inline just ahead of the first-of-month cell so scrolling keeps the label anchored to day one.

Files Changed:
- src/components/Calendar.jsx — annotated each day with a month-ownership flag when rendering weeks.
- src/components/DayCell.jsx — applied an `outside-month` class for styling when the day is outside the active month.
- src/styles/day-cell.css — introduced muted treatments for overflow cells in both light and dark themes.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- Confirm design review approves the new muted styling; adjust opacity if readability feedback comes in.

** Session: Smooth Year Jump Navigation
Time: Late night
Task: Reduce jitter when jumping ±12 months via keyboard or HUD
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
Pressing `P/N` (±12 months) felt like a stuttering scroll—each retry shifted by one viewport and the animation re-ran several times before landing on the target month.

Root Cause:
`useMonthNavigation` fell back to `scrollIntoView` when the target month wasn’t already mounted. Virtualization renders months on demand, so the hook would scroll chunk-by-chunk until the page physically contained the target DOM node, producing the month-by-month pogo animation.

Solution:
- Routed month jumps through the virtualization API by calling `scrollToDate` for the first day of the target month.
- Kept a DOM fallback only if virtualization declines the request (unsupported environments).
- Enhanced HUD copy to surface the exact destination (e.g., "Scrolling to next month (December 2025)").
- Split the HUD message into title + subline so month/year renders on its own line for better legibility.
- Restyled the HUD core panel (larger title, neon month subline, tightened letter spacing) to match the richer layout.
- Iterated on the panel to tighten spacing and typography so the stacked layout feels compact on desktop.

Files Changed:
- src/hooks/useMonthNavigation.js — uses `useCalendar` to access `scrollToDate`, formats HUD labels with the destination month/year, and lets the virtualized list handle long-distance jumps smoothly.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- Consider exposing `scrollToMonthIndex` explicitly if future features need absolute month addressing.

** Session: Keystroke Overlay Feedback
Time: Late night
Task: Surface registered shortcuts without overloading the HUD
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
Users wanted an immediate visual confirmation that a shortcut key registered, but piping the raw keystroke into the command HUD would overwhelm its semantic messaging.

Solution:
- Added a lightweight `KeystrokeFeedbackProvider` with a dedicated `KeystrokeOverlay` pill positioned near the header.
- Instrumented `useKeyboardShortcuts` to emit formatted chord labels (e.g., `⌘ + Shift + P`, `N`) whenever a handled shortcut fires.
- Styled the overlay with an oversized monospace glyph that fades after ~650 ms, distinct from the command HUD, and suppressed it entirely on mobile viewports to avoid clutter.

Files Changed:
- src/contexts/KeystrokeFeedbackContext.jsx — state + timer management for keystroke feedback.
- src/components/KeystrokeOverlay.jsx — visual pill rendering.
- src/styles/keystroke-overlay.css — overlay aesthetics for light/dark modes.
- src/App.jsx / src/main.jsx — wired provider + stylesheet.
- src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.js — emits keystroke labels alongside command announcements.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- Explore batching for rapid sequences if future workflows demand macro chords.

** Session: HUD & Mobile Header Polish
Time: Late night
Task: Compact the HUD and align mobile month labels with day one
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
The refreshed HUD consumed more vertical space than desired, and on mobile the top-of-month label could drift away from the first day while scrolling through stacked weeks.

Solution:
- Streamlined the HUD core module with tighter padding, smaller typography, and a structured `{label, description}` layout so the destination month/year renders as a dedicated subline.
- Added a keystroke pulse overlay (large red glyph) that mirrors desktop shortcuts, vertically centered along the right edge and auto-hiding within ~0.4 s.
- Embedded a secondary month header directly before the first-of-month cell on mobile; the primary header hides under 768 px so the inline version scrolls with day one.

Files Changed:
- src/hooks/useMonthNavigation.js — emits `{ label, description }` payloads and routes jumps through `scrollToDate` before announcing HUD text.
- src/styles/command-feedback.css — tightened HUD spacing, typography, and glow treatments to fit the richer messaging.
- src/contexts/KeystrokeFeedbackContext.jsx, src/styles/keystroke-overlay.css — centered the keystroke glyph, matched the today-cell red, and shortened dwell time.
- src/components/Calendar.jsx, src/styles/mobile.css — render inline month headers ahead of the first day on mobile while hiding the desktop header.

Tests:
- npm run build

Next Step:
- Gather usability feedback on the compact HUD and mobile inline header; tweak spacing if readability suffers on smaller devices.

** Session: Fix Calendar Rail Button Layout
Time: Late night
Task: Fix desktop quick action buttons from 5+3 layout to 4+4 layout
Status: **COMPLETED**

Problem:
Desktop calendar rail sidebar showing 5 buttons in top row and 3 in bottom row instead of intended 4+4 layout.

Root Cause:
The `.calendar-rail__actions` grid was using `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(36px, 1fr))` which caused automatic column wrapping based on available space (220px rail width), resulting in uneven distribution.

Solution:
Changed grid to `repeat(4, auto)` to force exactly 4 columns per row, with buttons sized at 36px and icons at 24px.

Files Changed:
- src/styles/header.css
  - Line 130: Changed grid-template-columns from `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(36px, 1fr))` to `repeat(4, auto)`
  - Line 131: Reduced gap from 0.45rem to 0.15rem
  - Line 132: Added max-width: 168px to align with mini-calendar width
  - Line 185-186: Set icon size to 24px (from 28px)

Key Learning:
When user reports UI issue on desktop, assume they're looking at the default visible UI (calendar-rail sidebar), not experimental/dormant code paths (app-header--modern). The modern header only displays when experimental variants are active.

** Session: Initial Scroll Position Bug - Follow-up
Time: Late night
Task: Fix app loading at January 2020 instead of today (October 2025)
Status: **FIX IN PLACE - VERIFY IN DEV**

Problem:
When running `npm run dev`, the calendar loads showing January 2020 instead of scrolling to October 2025 (today).

Initial Analysis:
- VirtualizedMonthList.jsx receives `initialDate` prop (systemToday = Oct 6, 2025)
- VirtualizedMonthList.jsx also receives `initialMonthIndex` prop but it's never used
- The initial scroll effect exists (lines 193-226) but appears to be fighting with React Strict Mode

Debugging Discoveries:
1. **React Strict Mode Double Mounting**: In development, React Strict Mode mounts → unmounts → remounts components, causing effects to run twice
2. **Effect Cancellation**: The cleanup function clears the setTimeout before it can execute
3. **Ref Persistence**: `hasInitialScrollRef` persists across unmount/remount, causing second mount to skip scroll
4. **Scroll IS Executing**: Logs show scroll to position 91353px (correct for October 2025), but virtualization hasn't rendered that month yet
5. **Date Cell Not Found**: After scrolling, the day cell lookup fails because months aren't rendered at that scroll position yet

Attempted Fixes (ALL FAILED):
1. **Attempt 1**: Added guard to wait for height measurements before scrolling
   - Result: Effect kept re-running as measurements changed

2. **Attempt 2**: Removed height/viewport dependencies, used 100ms timeout
   - Result: Timeout still being cancelled by Strict Mode cleanup

3. **Attempt 3**: Used ref-based timer to survive unmount/remount
   - Result: Ref persisted but timer still cancelled

4. **Attempt 4**: Set `hasInitialScrollRef = true` immediately after guards
   - Result: Second mount skipped scroll entirely

5. **Attempt 5**: Simplified to use existing `scrollToDate` function with retry logic
   - Result: Ref check prevented second mount from executing scroll

6. **Attempt 6**: Added scroll position check (`window.scrollY > 1000`) before skipping
   - Result: Still not working (current state)

Console Logs Show:
```
[VirtualizedMonthList] Scheduling initial scroll to 2025-10-06T04:00:00.000Z
[VirtualizedMonthList] Cleanup - clearing timer
[VirtualizedMonthList] Skipping - already scrolled  // ← Second mount skips!
```

Root Cause Hypothesis:
The combination of:
1. React Strict Mode's double mount behavior
2. Ref persistence across mounts
3. Effect cleanup cancelling setTimeout
4. Virtualization not rendering distant months immediately

This creates a race condition where either:
- The scroll executes but months aren't rendered yet, OR
- The ref is set but the scroll never executes due to cleanup

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/VirtualizedMonthList.jsx (multiple iterations)

Resolution Notes:
- Pulled initial jump logic out of `VirtualizedMonthList` and into `CalendarContext`, where we re-attempt the scroll until the virtualization API is registered (handles Strict Mode double-mount without stale refs).
- Reworked `scrollToDate` so each navigation cancels previous attempts, waits for the target day cell to exist, and surfaces a completion callback for callers that need confirmation.
- Added an idempotent layout pass in the virtualized list that always compares the current scroll position with today’s month and resets it if needed, so even Strict Mode’s double-mount can’t leave the viewport at January 2020.
- Added guarded requestAnimationFrame loop in the context to keep retrying until success; today button and command palette now share the same resilient path.
- Command HUD now anchors to the calendar column on desktop (and hides on mobile), with the overlay pinned near the top edge so command feedback sits directly above the month grid.

Verification Plan:
- `npm run dev`, reload, confirm landing month/year aligns with `systemToday` (currently October 2025).
- Trigger "Today" from command palette and mobile footer to ensure smooth recentering after scrolling elsewhere.

Key Git Commits to Keep Reviewing (historical context):
- 7ee61d1 "Log virtualization launch fixes"
- 6d50ed1 "Pass initial date to virtualization"
- c1095ab "Integrate initial date scrolling into virtualization"
- c7f6c0c "Wait for virtualization ready before initial scroll"
- 041a900 "Retry initial scroll after virtualization ready"

Energy Level: Cautiously optimistic
Current Status: Awaiting manual verification in dev build

Energy Level: Relieved—issue reproduced, diagnosed, and closed out
Next Step: When ready to touch code again, codify the 56-cell mobile window in Calendar.jsx and add regression testing

** Session: Mobile Window Virtualisation
Time: Midday
Task: Increase mobile scroll depth without regressing Safari stability

Accomplished:
- Refactored `Calendar.jsx` to derive week window settings from mobile/desktop configs
- Implemented sliding window logic (`extendWeekRange`) that keeps mobile DOM ≤16 weeks (~112 cells) while preserving infinite scroll feel
- Added responsive reset on breakpoint changes so orientation switches recompute the window
- Restored `KBarProvider` wrapper in `App.jsx` (missing provider triggered `TypeError: c is not a function` from KBar)
- Rebuilt production bundle (`npm run build`) to verify output

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/Calendar.jsx
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/App.jsx

Tests:
- npm run build

Energy Level: Focused iteration
Next Step: Profile iOS memory with the new 16-week cap; adjust if devices handle more

** Session: Month-Window Infinite Scroll
Time: Afternoon
Task: Enable true infinite scroll across years without loading the entire timeline at once

Accomplished:
- Reworked `Calendar.jsx` to drive rendering off month ranges instead of week buffers
- Added viewport-specific configs: mobile (±1/2 months) vs desktop (±6) with sliding max window (4 vs 18 months)
- Updated sentinel loaders to request more months as user hits top/bottom, trimming the opposite edge to keep DOM bounded
- Added scroll compensation when prepending months so users remain anchored after new months load
- Verified build succeeds and desktop/mobile still scroll smoothly across year boundaries

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/Calendar.jsx

Tests:
- npm run build

Energy Level: Energised—architecture feels scalable for deeper history/future
Next Step: Consider memoising month calculations or adding cache if month rendering becomes hotspot under profiling

** Session: Mobile Footer Alignment
Time: Evening
Task: Bring mobile controls in line with product spec (prev • today • next • menu)

Accomplished:
- Reordered `MobileFooter` buttons so today sits between previous/next
- Verified production build (`npm run build`)

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/MobileFooter.jsx

Tests:
- npm run build

Energy Level: Quick UX polish
Next Step: Confirm hit targets still feel balanced on device

** Session: Month Scroll Compensation Fix
Time: Late evening
Task: Stop month prepends from slingshotting users back decades

Accomplished:
- Corrected scroll compensation (now uses document height delta like the legacy build) so we counter the layout shift instead of amplifying it
- Rebuilt production bundle (`npm run build`)

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/Calendar.jsx

Tests:
- npm run build

Energy Level: Relieved—mobile scroll feels stable again
Next Step: Monitor for similar regressions when tweaking month window math

** Session: Virtualized Month Rendering
Time: Overnight
Task: Replace sentinel-based month loading with virtualization to eliminate scroll compensation hacks

Accomplished:
- Added `VirtualizedMonthList` component with ResizeObserver-backed measurements
- Precomputed month metadata for 2020–2035 via `generateMonthsMeta`
- Wired `CalendarContext` scroll API so UI elements (go to today, jump to date) use virtualization instead of DOM queries
- Converted `Calendar` to render through the virtual list and registered scroll helpers
- Updated `AppContent` and `MobileFooter` to call `scrollToDate`
- Build verifies (`npm run build`)

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/Calendar.jsx

- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/utils/months.js
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/App.jsx

Tests:
- npm run build

Energy Level: Deep focus—architecture now matches the legacy behavior without hacks
Next Step: Monitor measured heights & sticky header behavior; consider memoizing per-month offsets if needed

** Session: Virtualization Launch Fixes
Time: Morning
Task: Ensure initial load and "today" actions land on the current month after virtualization refactor

Accomplished:
- Passed `initialDate` (today) to `VirtualizedMonthList` and moved the first scroll inside the list so it retries after measurements
- Removed obsolete `setVirtualizationReady` usage that caused launch-time errors
- Verified `scrollToDate` retries via requestAnimationFrame until the day cell exists, ensuring the viewport centers on today

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/Calendar.jsx
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/components/VirtualizedMonthList.jsx

Tests:
- npm run build

Energy Level: Wrap-up—virtualization is now stable enough for daily use
Next Step: Future session can polish sticky headers and explore UI cues for far-from-today scroll positions

** Session: UI Polish & Today Cell Highlighting Fix
Time: Evening
Task: Fix today cell red highlighting, restore rounded card design, enhance event styling

Accomplished:
- Fixed today cell not showing red by using more specific CSS selectors with !important
- Restored rounded card design from commit 7645242 with 14px border radius
- Changed today cell color to custom red #D43E44 (softer than original)
- Enhanced event/note cards with gradient backgrounds and layered shadows
- Improved text contrast for event text (darker at 88% opacity)
- Lightened event card backgrounds for better contrast
- Added letter-spacing to month/weekday labels (0.18em/0.24em)
- Made today's event text bold for emphasis

Files Modified:
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/src/styles/day-cell.css
- /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless/README.md

Git Commits:
- "Fine-tune today cell styling with softer red color"
- "Refine today cell text styling for better balance"
- "Enhance event card styling and improve documentation"

Notes:
- CSS specificity was the main issue with today highlighting - needed `.day-cell.today.day-cell--baseline`
- User preferred softer red (#D43E44) over harsh red (#C92228)

Energy Level: Productive, iterative refinement
Next Step: Continue polishing UI details based on user feedback

Technical Details:
- Modified /src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.js for new key bindings
- Updated /src/components/HelpOverlay.jsx with animation fixes
- Branch `shadcn-help` merged into `main`

Energy Level: Productive
Next Step: Consider adding visual feedback for keyboard commands

** Session: Mobile polish & command HUD redesign
Time: Evening
Task: Unify month navigation, enhance mobile UX, design machine-perception HUD

Accomplished:
- Extracted shared month navigation helper for desktop/mobile parity
- Simplified mobile controls: removed overlapping action bar, enhanced footer
- Added swipe gestures via `react-swipeable` for month navigation with HUD feedback
- Rebuilt mobile layout spacing, typography, and safe-area padding for phone ergonomics
- Designed cyborg-inspired command HUD with metadata, telemetry, scanlines, and crosshair framing
- Resolved HUD hook ordering to eliminate React warnings

Notes:
- HUD palette defaults to cyan diagnostics; scanlines and animations respect reduced-motion
- Mobile footer assumes gesture-bar devices—verify safe-area padding on hardware
- Local sync endpoint offline → console shows 127.0.0.1 fetch failures (expected in dev)

Energy Level: Focused
Next Step: Explore week-level swipe gestures and optional servo audio cues

** Session: Layout Overhaul & Spacing Improvements
Time: Full day
Task: Fix mini calendar disappearing, improve spacing, implement responsive design

Problems Addressed:
1. Mini calendar disappearing issue (Critical)
   - Root cause: Position sticky inside scrolling container
   - Calendar auto-scroll to today moved the sticky rail off-screen
   - Multiple cascading issues masked the real problem

2. Calendar cutoff on right edge
   - Compound padding from nested containers
   - Hidden overflow masked the actual overflow issue

3. Poor spacing and sizing
   - Components too large and cramped
   - No max-width constraints for ultra-wide monitors
   - UI stuck to left side on large displays

Solutions Implemented:

Fixed Positioning System:
#+begin_src css
.calendar-rail {
  position: fixed;
  top: 3rem;
  left: max(2rem, calc((100vw - 1500px) / 2 + 2rem));
  width: 240px;
}

.calendar-layout {
  padding-left: 380px;
  max-width: 1500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
#+end_src

Component Size Reductions:
- Calendar rail: 260px → 240px width
- Brand title: 1.1rem → 1rem
- Mini calendar months: 200px → 180px
- Mini calendar fonts: 0.82em → 0.75em
- Overall padding: Reduced by ~25%

Layout Constraints:
- App shell max-width: 1800px
- Calendar max-width: 1500px (1200px content area)
- Spacing between sidebar and content: 380px

Lessons Learned:
1. Position fixed vs sticky: Fixed positioning required for sidebars with infinite scroll
2. Debug overflow issues: Temporarily set `overflow: visible` to see true bounds
3. Check media queries: Hidden `display: none` can cause mysterious disappearances
4. Component hierarchy matters: CSS can't fix structural React issues

Time Spent:
- Debugging mini calendar: ~45 minutes
- Layout fixes: ~30 minutes
- Documentation: ~15 minutes

Mobile Layout Implementation:
- Created responsive mobile layout (≤768px)
- One day per row display with horizontal layout
- Hidden mini calendar for maximum content space
- Touch-optimized with larger tap targets
- Full width calendar utilization

UI Centering Fix:
- Treated sidebar + calendar as single 1500px block
- Entire UI centers on displays >1600px
- Proper alignment formula: `calc(50% - 750px + 2rem)`

Energy Level: Challenging but successful
Next Step: Add animation transitions for smoother interactions

** Session: Mobile layout polish
Time: Afternoon
Task: Improve mobile calendar spacing and composer UX

Accomplished:
- Reduced mobile calendar gutters so day cards span wider on phones
- Shrunk blank day cells via min-height/padding clamps for denser scrolling
- Introduced modal mobile event composer to keep text entry centered instead of inline
- Right-aligned mobile day headers and sourced weekday/month abbreviations from dateUtils canonical lists

Energy Level: Focused
Next Step: QA on multiple mobile breakpoints; consider haptic feedback pass for tap cues
