#+title: Experimental Mode Feedback Log
#+options: toc:nil

* 2025-10-02 Timeless Experimental Mode Variants Testing
** Strong Dislikes (Never Use Again)
- Dark themes in general — avoid dark backgrounds across all projects
- Brutalist Grid — hate this style entirely
- Memphis Postmodern — terrible, garish
- Vaporwave Sunset — garish aesthetic
- Solar Dawn — too intense, too bright and in your face

** Moderate Dislikes
- Paper Atlas — too blah, too bland
- Paper Craft — too blah, too bland
- Botanical Minimal — mint green color is grating
- Aurora Glass — dark theme plus overlapping cell borders look sloppy
- Liquid Motion — dark theme
- Holographic Shimmer — dark theme

** Technical Notes
- [Resolved 2025-10-02] Zen Monoline hover no longer shifts, so day cell borders stay aligned

** Will Review Further (Promising)
- Calm Pastels — evaluate the softened palette after adjustments
- Zen Monoline — confirm minimal grid readability with new timeline spine
- Nordic Frost — ensure frosted accents still feel premium
- Soft Studio — revisit gradients and glassmorphism balance

** Design Principles Extracted
1. Prefer light themes over dark themes
2. Avoid garish, high-contrast, or overly intense color palettes
3. Avoid bland, low-contrast designs
4. Keep borders clean — no overlapping or sloppy edge treatments
5. Balance intensity — not too bright, not too dull

** Removed from Variant Rotation
- Modern UI — purple/indigo gradient feels harsh
- Aurora Glass — too dark and overlapping borders
- Paper Atlas — too bland
- Solar Dawn — too intense
- Paper Craft — too bland
- Liquid Motion — dark theme
- Botanical Minimal — mint green is grating
- Brutalist Grid — hated aesthetic
- Holographic Shimmer — dark theme
- Vaporwave Sunset — garish
- Memphis Postmodern — terrible
- Neomorphic Zen — lack of contrast
- Micro Interactions Lab — too in-your-face
