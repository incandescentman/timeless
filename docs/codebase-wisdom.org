* The 30-Minute Header Gap: When CSS Sticky Meets Fixed Positioning
  Date: 2025-10-01

** The Bug
   The day-of-week headers in the React calendar kept overlapping with the fixed header buttons at the top. When trying to fix it, the headers would either:
   - Disappear completely behind the buttons
   - Show transparent gaps above them revealing scrolling content
   - Create new overlaps when "fixed"

** The Truth
   CSS `position: sticky` and `position: fixed` create different stacking contexts that don't play well together. The sticky element leaves a "hole" in the document flow where the background shows through. I was trying to patch this hole with increasingly complex pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) with different positioning, but each patch created new edge cases.

   **Key insight that would have saved time:**
   - `position: sticky` elements exist in normal document flow until they "stick", then create a new stacking context
   - When stuck, they leave empty space in the document flow that shows whatever background is behind
   - Pseudo-elements with different positioning contexts (absolute vs fixed vs sticky) compound the problem
   - **The answer is always a dedicated background layer**, not patching with pseudo-elements

** Why This Took 30+ Minutes
   1. **Wrong mental model**: Thought in terms of "filling gaps" instead of "creating layers"
   2. **Incremental patching**: Each fix (adjusting top, z-index, padding) seemed to work until it created a new problem
   3. **Pseudo-element rabbit hole**: Kept adding ::before/::after elements with different position values (absolute, fixed, sticky)
   4. **Not stepping back**: Instead of redesigning, kept tweaking the broken approach

** The Fix
   Created a three-layer architecture:
   #+begin_src css
   /* Layer 1: Background (z-index: 90) */
   .calendar-wrapper {
     position: fixed;
     top: 0;
     height: 140px;
     background: white;  /* Solid fill, no transparency! */
     z-index: 90;
   }

   /* Layer 2: Sticky content (z-index: 500) */
   #calendar thead {
     position: sticky;
     top: 80px;
     z-index: 500;
     background: white;  /* Must be solid */
   }

   /* Layer 3: Fixed UI (z-index: 1000) */
   #header {
     position: fixed;
     top: 0;
     z-index: 1000;
   }
   #+end_src

** Lessons Learned / Prevention Checklist
   - [ ] **Draw the layer stack first** - Visualize z-index layers before coding
   - [ ] **Use solid background wrapper** - Don't try to patch gaps, prevent them
   - [ ] **Avoid pseudo-element gap-filling** - If you're using ::before to fill space, rethink the approach
   - [ ] **Check all color modes** - Transparent backgrounds often reveal themselves in dark mode
   - [ ] **Step back after 3 failed attempts** - If tweaking isn't working, the approach is wrong
   - [ ] **Remember the three-layer pattern** for sticky + fixed:
     1. Fixed background layer (lowest z-index) - prevents any gaps
     2. Sticky content layer (middle z-index) - your scrolling headers
     3. Fixed UI layer (highest z-index) - navigation that stays on top

* Vite CSS @import Errors: Why CSS Imports Failed in React
  Date: 2025-10-01

** The Bug
   After converting to React/Vite, got persistent console errors:
   ```
   [vite:css] @import must precede all other statements (besides @charset or empty @layer)
   ```
   Even after moving @imports to the top of the CSS file, errors persisted.

** The Truth
   Vite processes CSS imports differently than vanilla HTML. Even a single blank line or comment before @import breaks it. But more importantly, Vite actually prefers JavaScript imports over CSS @imports for better HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and bundling.

** Why This Took Multiple Attempts
   1. **First attempt**: Moved @imports to top but left blank line above them
   2. **Second attempt**: Removed blank line but kept comment above
   3. **Third attempt**: Clean @imports at top, but Vite cache held old errors
   4. **Wrong approach entirely**: Should have used JS imports from the start

** The Fix
   Import CSS files in JavaScript instead of using CSS @import:
   #+begin_src javascript
   // In main.jsx - import all CSS here
   import './styles/calendar.css';
   import './styles/day-cell.css';
   import './styles/header.css';
   import './styles/mini-calendar.css';
   import './styles/overlays.css';
   import './styles/mobile.css';
   import './styles/index.css';  // Variables last if others depend on them
   #+end_src

** Lessons Learned / Prevention Checklist
   - [ ] **Use JS imports for CSS in Vite** - Don't use CSS @import statements
   - [ ] **Clear Vite cache after CSS changes** - `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
   - [ ] **Order matters** - Import dependencies before files that use them
   - [ ] **Check bundler docs first** - Vite/webpack handle CSS differently than vanilla HTML
