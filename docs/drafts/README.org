#+DESCRIPTION: Work-in-progress documentation and notes

* Purpose

This directory contains work-in-progress documentation, exploratory notes, and unpolished ideas that aren't ready for the main /docs directory.

* What Belongs Here

- Rough notes from brainstorming sessions
- Experimental feature designs
- Draft ADRs that need review
- Investigation notes for complex bugs
- Temporary documentation during major refactors

* What Doesn't Belong Here

- Completed documentation (promote to /docs)
- Code comments (put inline in source)
- Permanent project notes
- Anything over 6 months old without activity

* Promotion Process

When a draft is ready to become official documentation:

1. Review and polish the content
2. Add proper org-mode headers (TITLE, DATE, TAGS)
3. Add cross-references to related docs
4. Move to /docs
5. Update CLAUDE.org if it's a major addition
6. Delete the draft file

* Cleanup Policy

- **Weekly**: Review drafts for anything ready to promote
- **Monthly**: Delete stale drafts (over 1 month old with no updates)
- **Quarterly**: Audit entire directory, archive anything worth keeping to docs/archive/

* Current Drafts

_No drafts currently_
