#+title: Timeless Calendar — Instructions
#+date: 2025-10-13

* Overview
Timeless is an infinite scroll calendar application built with React. It provides seamless navigation through weeks, months, and years with persistent note-taking capabilities. The calendar stores data locally with optional server sync via Redis.

* Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

* Install & Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cd /Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/timeless
   #+END_SRC

2. Install dependencies:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npm install
   #+END_SRC

3. Start development server (auto-opens browser):
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npm run dev
   #+END_SRC

4. Build production bundle:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npm run build && npm run preview
   #+END_SRC

* Access Modes
- **Local Development**: Run =npm run dev= for full editing capabilities with hot reload. Vite serves on port 5173 by default.
- **Production Preview**: Run =npm run build && npm run preview= to test the production build locally.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Deployed builds include serverless API functions for optional Redis sync.
- **Offline Mode**: Calendar works entirely offline using LocalStorage. Server sync is optional enhancement.

* Core Features

** Infinite Calendar
- Seamless scrolling through past and future dates
- Pre-renders ±26 weeks around current view
- Automatic extension when reaching boundaries
- Seven-column week layout with shared borders

** Note Management
- Add/edit notes for any day
- Multiple notes per day with card-style layout
- Auto-resizing text areas
- Markdown-style shortcuts (Ctrl+B/I/H for bold/italic/headers)
- Swipe-to-delete on mobile
- Multi-select mode for bulk operations

** Navigation Systems
- **Mini Calendar**: Three-month sidebar view with wheel navigation
- **Year View**: Annual grid overlay for long-distance jumps
- **Command Palette**: ⌘K/Ctrl+K for quick actions
- **Natural Language**: Jump to "next friday", "december 2024", etc.

** Data Management
- **LocalStorage**: Primary storage, works offline
- **JSON Export/Import**: Full backup and restore capability
- **Markdown Export**: Export notes as diary format
- **Server Sync**: Optional Redis-backed sync (requires API setup)

* Layout & Responsive Design

** Desktop (>768px)
- Fixed 240px sidebar with mini calendar
- Main calendar: 1440px width, centered
- Total UI width: 1680px (auto-centers on large displays)
- Seamless seven-column grid with shared borders

** Mobile (≤768px)
- No sidebar (mini calendar hidden)
- Full viewport width
- One day per row, card-style layout
- Bottom action bar: Prev • Today • Next • Menu
- Swipe gestures for note management

* Keyboard Shortcuts

** Navigation
- =⌘K= / =/= - Command palette
- =t= - Jump to today
- =y= - Year view overlay
- =p= / =n= - Previous/next month
- =P= / =N= - Previous/next year (12-month jumps)
- =i= - Enter navigation mode
- =?= - Help overlay

** Editing
- =c= / =T= - Add note to today
- =m= - Multi-select mode
- =Tab= / =⇧Tab= - Save & move between notes
- =Return= - Save & exit editing
- =⌘Z= / =⌘Y= - Undo/redo
- =Backspace= - Delete selected day's notes

** System
- =⌘D= - Toggle dark mode
- =⌘E= / =Ctrl+E= - Export as markdown diary
- =Esc= - Close overlays

* Development Environment

** Environment Variables
Create =.env.local= with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=your-api-endpoint  # Optional for server sync
REDIS_URL=your-redis-connection      # Optional for server sync
#+END_SRC

** File Structure
- =src/main.jsx= - Application entry point
- =src/App.jsx= - Root component with providers
- =src/contexts/= - CalendarContext and ThemeContext
- =src/components/= - Reusable UI components
- =src/utils/= - Storage, date utilities, helpers
- =src/styles/= - Global CSS (imported in main.jsx)
- =api/calendar.js= - Serverless function for server sync
- =docs/= - Project documentation

** Key Components
- =Calendar.jsx= - Infinite scroll calendar grid
- =DayCell.jsx= - Individual day with note editing
- =Header.jsx= - Top bar with mini calendar and controls
- =MiniCalendar.jsx= - Three-month sidebar navigation
- =YearView.jsx= - Annual overview overlay
- =CommandPalette.jsx= - ⌘K quick actions

* Data Storage & Sync

** LocalStorage (Primary)
- Calendar data stored as JSON in browser
- Automatic saving on every edit
- Undo/redo stacks maintained
- Works completely offline

** Optional Server Sync
- Redis-backed sync via serverless API
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Debounced saves (reduces API calls)
- Falls back to localStorage if unavailable

** Export/Import
- JSON backup includes all notes and metadata
- Markdown export downloads `jay-diary.md` with year/month headings and indented daily bullets
- Import validates and merges with existing data

* Experimental Mode
- Uses =@jaydixit/experimental-mode= package
- Enables feature variants and A/B testing
- Configuration in experimental mode contexts
- See =docs/experimental-mode-plan.org= for details

* Testing & Build

** Development
- Vite dev server with hot reload
- React Fast Refresh for component updates
- CSS changes apply instantly

** Production Build
- Vite optimizes and bundles for production
- Tree-shaking removes unused code
- Assets optimized and fingerprinted
- Preview mode tests production build locally

** Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Modern ES2020+ features used

* Troubleshooting

** Common Issues
- **Calendar not centering**: Check viewport width, ensure CSS variables loaded
- **Notes not saving**: Verify LocalStorage permissions, check console errors
- **Keyboard shortcuts not working**: Check for input focus conflicts
- **Mini calendar missing**: Mobile viewport detected, working as intended
- **Server sync failing**: Verify =VITE_API_BASE_URL= and Redis connection

** Development Debug
- Use React DevTools for component inspection
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify LocalStorage data in DevTools Application tab
- Test API endpoints independently if using server sync

* Architecture Notes
- State managed via React Context (CalendarContext, ThemeContext)
- Global keyboard shortcuts via custom hook
- Infinite scroll uses intersection observers
- Date utilities keep calendar logic reusable
- Responsive design uses CSS media queries
- Theme switching via CSS custom properties
