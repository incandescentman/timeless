#+title: Timeless React Overview

* Project Overview
- React/Vite single-page app: ~src/main.jsx:1~ boots ~App~ into ~#root~ and layers shared styles for layout, calendar grid, overlays, and mobile tweaks.
- Root composition in ~src/App.jsx:1~ wraps everything in ~ThemeProvider~ and ~CalendarProvider~, renders the infinite calendar, header, mobile action bar, and toggled overlays (year view, help, command palette, spinner).
- Feature set matches the original Timeless calendar—local-only storage, infinite past/future weeks, keyboard navigation, multi-select, natural-language jumps—now organized into reusable components.

* State & Utilities
- ~src/contexts/CalendarContext.jsx:1~ centralizes calendar data, undo/redo stacks, selection/range state, and exposes helpers like ~addNote~, ~toggleDaySelection~, and ~getNotesForDate~; all persistence lives in ~localStorage~.
- Storage helpers in ~src/utils/storage.js:1~ serialize day notes (keyed as ~month_day_year~), handle import/export (JSON, Markdown diary), and maintain a ~lastSavedTimestamp~.
- Date utilities in ~src/utils/dateUtils.js:1~ cover ID generation, week/month math, natural-language parsing (“next friday”), and display formatting; they keep the app calendar-agnostic and reusable.
- ~src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx:1~ toggles dark mode by flipping a body class and persisting a ~darkMode~ flag.
- Global keyboard handling via ~src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.js:1~ binds Cmd/Ctrl+K palette, undo/redo, navigation, multi-select, date jumps, and dark-mode toggle while respecting focused inputs.

* Interface Modules
- ~src/components/Calendar.jsx:1~ builds the infinite week table, prerenders ±26 weeks, scrolls to today on mount, observes sentinel rows to extend upward/downward, and injects month boundary headers.
- ~src/components/DayCell.jsx:1~ handles per-day note editing: in-cell textarea with auto-resize, markdown-ish shortcuts (Ctrl+B/I/H), escape/enter behavior, multi-select toggles, and visual states for today/weekends/selection.
- ~src/components/Header.jsx:1~ combines the mini calendar, branding, and controls for dark mode, jump-to-today, year view, exports/imports, help, and undo; import reads JSON into ~localStorage~ then reloads.
- ~src/components/MiniCalendar.jsx:1~ renders three months side-by-side, coloring today and noted days, with wheel-driven month navigation and smooth scrolling to clicked dates.
- ~src/components/YearView.jsx:1~ overlays an annual grid, tracks the chosen year, highlights notes/today, and closes after jumping to a day.
- ~src/components/CommandPalette.jsx:1~, ~HelpOverlay.jsx:1~, and ~MobileActionBar.jsx:1~ provide palette actions (go to today, dark mode, exports, jump dialog), shortcut documentation, and mobile-first navigation buttons.

* Running & Legacy
- Install and launch with ~npm install~ then ~npm run dev~ (Vite defaults overridden to port 5000 in ~vite.config.js:1~; host is exposed for LAN/Replit access).
- ~docs/~, ~README-REACT.md~, and the various ~README.*~ files capture migration notes and original design intent; legacy vanilla assets remain in ~index-vanilla.html~, ~calendar.js~, and ~old-assets/~ for reference.
- PHP stub ~api.php~ and server-sync hooks are still unused in this React edition; everything operates client-side with persistence in browser storage.
- Styles live under ~src/styles/~ and are imported globally, so any adjustments there cascade through the whole UI.

* Next Steps (Optional)
1. Run ~npm run dev~ and explore the UI/features in the browser.
2. Review ~README-REACT.md~ alongside ~docs/codebase-wisdom.org~ for historical context and future plans.
